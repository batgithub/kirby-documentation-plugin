# kirby-release-plugin
The plugin is at [protyping level](https://www.figma.com/file/XJD23d5TJARaMmNxUoYA2h/kirby-maintenance-plugins?type=design&node-id=1501%3A23446&mode=design&t=9Tc8z9nBL0mBmdV0-1). 

The idea is to create a release page accessible from the front end.

**Why this plugin ?**

I want to avoid dependancy from other services (notion, github...) to provide a good maintenance of kirby websites. 

**Features**
- Releases page with dev and creator informations
- Access API for maintenance. It will be consume by another plugin dashboard (I'm also working on it).

**How I think I'm going to build this ?**
- [ ] Blueprint releases
- [ ] Blueprint releases-post
- [ ] Template releases
- [ ] create custom css for this page


## Prototype
